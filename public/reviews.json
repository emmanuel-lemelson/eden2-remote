          "review": "We had a wonderful experience staying at Eden for a family gathering. Our hosts were very responsive through all aspects of the booking process, preparations for our stay and during our stay. Everything was so well organized and a lot of very helpful information was shared proactively. The estate is beautiful and has everything you could need. We especially enjoyed spending time by the pool, which is a beautiful setting. The kids had plenty to entertain themselves, including the pool, hot tub, tennis and game room. It’s a unique place, and we only wish we could have stayed longer."

          "review": "Absolutely loved this place, worth every single penny…. Secluded, beautiful, fun, and spacious. I was addicted walking barefoot through the property, and loved the swim in the pond. We went to Stowe to see the surrounding areas, but felt like we were having to convince ourselves to leave this sanctuary. The service was the best I’ve EVER experienced, nonstop communication, and instant responses, if I had a question about the surrounding areas, or concerns about the house, I was met with the most upbeat and friendly energy I’ve ever experienced with an AirBNB. Honestly, I’ve stayed at many places, and most make you feel like a client to take money from… staying here I truly felt like a guest."

The landlord contacted us immediately after the reservation and provided a detailed brochure with all the necessary information on it. We asked a lot of questions regarding this trip, and asked for some last minute setup, the landlord responded quickly and tried their best to help us, which we really appreciated that. The overall experience during the trip was excellent, they had a team to get everything set up for us. If you are planning a trip for a large group, we would recommend this property for sure since they have a supportive team and will do their best to meet your expectation!"

It was absolutely beautiful throughout the house and had so many perks and special amenities—we definitely felt like we were staying in a very luxurious place. The sauna, steam room, and hot tub were the perfect way to relax and unwind. The heated floors were an added plus as it’s was snowing the whole weekend outside. The fireplaces were fully stocked with wood. For our dinner, the team set us up with a wonderful private chef who helped us create the perfect customized menu and they also connected us with a bartender for our special “signature” drinks and served wine and champagne during dinner. We cannot be more thankful for choosing the Estate as our wedding venue—almost all of our family got to stay with us on site. We look forward to staying here again."

          "review": "From a family of 4 living in Florida trying to experience snow during their winter vacation, this home in itself IS an experience. The property is spacious, private and yet conveniently close to restaurants, ski resort and town. The house was equipped with every single entertainment you can think of. Our kids enjoyed playing with all the sleds, board games, toys especially the air hockey machine. My husband and I played pool, enjoyed the jacuzzi and steam room, as well. We also connected with their concierge that provided us with excellent service in booking ski lessons, in home massage and transportation. Not to mention, the owners are the most accommodating, helpful, friendliest people we’ve ever communicated with. Thank you Lemelson family for making our trip to Stowe unforgettable. We look forward to next stay!"

Big open areas for the group to convene while also having small private areas and bedrooms if we wanted to get away for a few minutes. The location was also very convenient. Close to town and extremely close to hiking opportunities. We are very happy with our choice to stay at this property and will be back again in the future."

The great room is beautiful and a lovely spot to relax after skiing. The sauna, hot tub and game room are outstanding. The beds are exceptionally comfortable as well. The host is a lovely and genuinely kind person. He works very hard to provide an exceptional experience for his guests. We would have liked to stay longer. There are many more amenities to enjoy. Five star hosts and five star house. Highly recommend and would love to return."

If you have to work, there is a large quiet office. My grandkids ages 4 to 14 and adults 😀enjoyed the air hockey table, pool table and a closet full of toys and games. Kitchen is well equipment with everything you need. We cooked and grilled a few nights. The pool and hot tubs were fantastic with beautiful views of the Mountains and Gardens. We had some tennis players in our group too, courts were an extra bonus to have on the property. I enjoyed walking the property and looking at the ponds and all the different plants and flowers in the Gardens. House is in a great location just a very short drive to Stowe, waterfalls, swimming holes etc. Hiking trailhead on the property too. The owner was available anytime to answer any questions we had. I highly recommend this house. Beautifully set on 30 acres with views of Mountains and the most awesome sunsets! Our stay was enjoyed by everyone. Hated to leave. Thank you for sharing your beautiful home."

          "review": "Eden - The Lemelson Estate is an absolutely gorgeous property nestled in the mountains of the wonderful town of Stowe, Vt. The homeowners and all their property management staff are lovely and delightfully accommodating. I have worked for the Lemelson estate off and on for years when my schedule allows and they are a lovely family. The property is handled with care and precision. Anytime they need my help I’m happy to assist. Easy to work with and always a positive experience :) The house is a great size for multiple families or small groups as it has the apartment and upstairs wing which both have their own privacy. Overall I’d say everything about this rental is five star top notch, and with a Vermont feel … meaning perfection, but simpler. Love all around."

          "review": "Wonderful experience having our wedding at Eden. From our first moments of inquiry, we had fast responses, plenty of helpful suggestions, and were accommodated for all our needs. The main bedroom was a wonderful bridal suite, with plenty of mirrors and sitting space. All the bedrooms were utilized for our families to stay in—no need for hiring Uber or transportation. The chef created a family style dinner that suited us and all our dietary needs. The steam shower and sauna were a wonderful way to relax in the chill of a late February snow storm. The playroom was fun for the groomsmen to enjoy while “getting ready”, playing foosball and pool. We had our ceremony in the great room with the fireplace roaring—a fiery love story. We adore Stowe and are so happy to have such fond memories of our wedding in the heart of Stowe at the Eden Estate. We regret not having a Clydesdale horse ride across the street—didn’t have enough time but that would’ve been the perfect extra touch that staff had suggested we do for a fun activity. Throughout our short planning (about 6 weeks from start to wedding day) staff was extremely helpful and responsive, had a welcoming basket ready, extra linens and were able to set up an extra bed for us. We were warm all weekend using all the fireplaces with plenty of wood already stored for us. Would suggest Eden for your wedding, small or big."

          "review": "From the moment we ascended the winding road leading to the mansion, we knew we were in for a treat. The grandeur of the estate took our breath away, with its stately architecture and panoramic views of Vermont’s rolling hills. The interior of the mansion was equally impressive, with spacious rooms that elegantly combined modern amenities with rustic charm. Each bedroom was a haven of comfort, offering serene mountain views to wake up to every morning. The grounds were a delight to explore, with well-maintained gardens and pathways that invited leisurely strolls. The highlight was the outdoor hot tub, where we soaked under the stars, enveloped by the tranquil sounds of nature. Our hosts were the epitome of hospitality, ensuring our stay was comfortable and memorable. They provided excellent recommendations for local hikes and dining options that enhanced our experience. This mansion is the perfect escape for anyone looking to immerse themselves in luxury and the beauty of Vermont’s mountains. It’s an ideal spot for family reunions, corporate retreats, or simply a lavish getaway. We left feeling rejuvenated and are already planning our return to this mountain paradise. If you’re looking for a place that offers both elegance and adventure, this is certainly the destination to consider."

From the moment we reached out, the communication was effective, timely, and accurate. The venue itself was spacious and beautiful, with a stunning grand staircase, opulent rooms and gorgeous grounds providing the ideal backdrop for wedding photos. The estate was incredibly convenient for the wedding party, and the close proximity to nearby amenities made the entire stay seamless. We could not have asked for a more perfect experience. Although their wedding ceremony was held elsewhere, we highly recommend the Lemelson Estate with its spacious interior and extensive well-tended grounds for a wedding ceremony as well as lodging and wedding photography."

We had a chef prepare a beautiful custom meal for us and a bartender to serve our custom cocktails. Staff at Eden were prompt and responsive and included a few special things upon arrival to make us feel welcome. We could not recommend Eden more, fantastic experience catered to us!"
